/**
 * The SwingGraphicsSample class provides a Swing-based implementation of the IGraphicsSample interface
 * for rendering graphical slides. This class sets up a user interface using JFrame and JTabbedPane,
 * where each tab represents a graphical slide.
 * <p>
 * This implementation demonstrates how graphical content can be dynamically generated and
 * rendered in a Swing application. The slides are created using factories that provide graphical
 * content, and they are rendered with high-quality settings.
 * <p>
 * The class includes several components:
 * - It defines application-level properties such as the application name.
 * - It initializes the graphical user interface using a tabbed pane to display multiple slides.
 * - It provides an implementation of the createSlide method to generate graphical panels using
 *   supplied factories.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * - This class sets a native look and feel for the Swing application.
 * - The main method serves as the entry point for launching the application.
 * - The createSlide method renders a graphical slide on a JPanel for any given slide factory.
