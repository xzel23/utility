## License

This library is developed by Axel Howind and available under the MIT License. Refer to the accompanying
file [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Source

Source code is available at https://github.com/xzel23/utility.

## Requirements

- JDK 21 or later, version 17 of the library requires JDK 17 or later (except for for JavaFX related modules that already require at least Java 21).
- Version 17 that still supports Java 17 will receive important bugfix updates until the next LTS release (Java 25) is released.
- The project uses Gradle toolchains to automatically download the required JDKs.
- JavaFX dependencies are managed by the JavaFX plugin.
- Building on Windows ARM is not supported because of missing support in Gradle and the toolchain resolver and 
  JavaFX plugins.

## Using the library

The Binaries are available on Maven Central Repository.

Java 21+ is needed for the current Version, for Java 17 projects, use version 17.x of the library.

### Maven

Replace `${utility_version}` with the current version.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.dua3.utility</groupId>
            <artifactId>utility</artifactId>
            <version>${utility_version}</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.dua3.utility</groupId>
            <artifactId>utility-db</artifactId>
            <version>${utility_version}</version>
        </dependency>
        ...

### Gradle

Replace `${utility_version}` with the current version.

    dependencies {
        compile        "com.dua3.utility:utility:${utility_version}"
        compile        "com.dua3.utility:utility-db:${utility_version}"
        ...        
    }

## Logging

**Log4J-API** is used for logging.

You can use whatever logging implementation you want, for configuration refer to the Log4J documentation. You can also
look at the swing samples that use a SwingLogPane and route all logging output regardless of source (Log4J, SLF4J, JUL)
to the logging implementation.

### utility-logging

This project adds a small lightweight implementation that can be used instead of SLF4J SimpleLogger. It is intended as a
lightweight logging implementation in desktop applications or during development and does not support advanced features
such as log rotation or writing to a database.

Configuration is done by providing a file called `logging.properties` on the classpath.

* configure log level:
   ```
    logger.level = (ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG|TRACE)(, <prefix>:(ERROR|WARN|INFO|DEBUG|TRACE))*
   ```
  setting ony the global level:
   ```
    logger.level = INFO
   ```
  setting global level and different levels for packages:
   ```
    logger.level = WARN, com.dua3.:DEBUG, my.current.project.:TRACE
   ```

* configure logging to console
   ```
    logger.console.stream = system.out|system.err
    logger.console.colored = true|false
   ```

* configure a log buffer (see below):
   ```
   logger.buffer = #entries
   ```

### Using SLF4J with different logging frameworks

Just to save time searching the internet for this:

* **JUL (java.util.logging)**

    * add "org.slf4j:jul-to-slf4j:<version>" to your dependencies

    * when using JPMS modules, add `requires jul.to.slf4j;` to your module-info.java

    * initialize the bridge handler:
       ```
       static {
           java.util.logging.LogManager.getLogManager().reset();
           SLF4JBridgeHandler.install();
       }
       ```

* **Log4J2**

    * add "org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j:2.18.0" to your dependencies

### SwingLogPane (Swing-widget for log viewing)

If you want to show logs in a swing application, configure a log buffer and add a SwingLogPane to your UI. Have a look
at the code of `SwingComponentsSample` for details.

## Using the BuildInfo class in Gradle builds

Add this to your `build.gradle` to include a `build.properties` file in your JAR:

    // === generate BuildInfo ===
    def generateBuildInfo = tasks.register('generateBuildInfo') {
        // do not cache the buildinfo
        outputs.upToDateWhen { false }

        // create build.properties
        doLast {
            def resourcesDir = sourceSets.main.output.resourcesDir
            resourcesDir.mkdirs()

            def buildTime = OffsetDateTime.now().atZoneSameInstant(ZoneId.of("UTC"))
            def contents = "build.time=${buildTime}\nbuild.version=${version}\n"

            def file = new File(resourcesDir, "build.properties")
            file.text = contents
        }
    }

Add this in your code to read the `build.properties` file and create a `BuildInfo` instance containing version and build
time information:

    public static final BuildInfo BUILD_INFO = BuildInfo.create(Main.class, "/build.properties");

## Cabe

Starting with version 14, utility uses [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev) annotations for all method parameters.

The resulting Jar files are instrumented using [Cabe](https://github.com/xzel23/cabe).

When you run your code with assertions disabled, virtually no overhead is introduced, as assertions are removed at
JVM level.

When running your code with exceptions enabled, parameters are checked for invalid null values and an AssertionError
will be generated when null is passed for a `@NonNull` annotated parameter. The assertion message contains the name of
the parameter.

## Benchmarks

The project includes JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) benchmarks to measure the performance of various utility methods.

### Running the benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, use the following Gradle command from the project root:

```
./gradlew jmh
```

This will execute all benchmark tests and generate a results file at `utility/build/results/jmh/results.txt`.

You can customize the benchmark execution by modifying the JMH configuration in the `utility/build.gradle.kts` file.

### Running the JavaFX samples

To run the JavaJF samples right from within your IDE, make sure to use a JDK that comes with JavaFX included like
Bellsoft Liberica JDK _FULL_ or Azul JDK _FX_. Otherwise you might see an error that the required JavaFX runtime classes
could not be loaded.

## Changes

### 20.0.0 (work in progress)

- A new artefact `utility-bom` has been introduced that specifies the version for all modules.

- Package `utility`
    - `LangUtil.reverseInPlace()` to reverse array contents
    - `RingBuffer` implements `SequencedCollection`
    - `LogBuffer.setCapacity()` to change the capacity of an existing buffer
    - Added `ReversedSequencedCollectionWrapper` to facilitate implementing `reversed()` for `SequencedCollection` 
      implementations
    - hardened `IoUtil.unzip()` and provided an overload to use custom limits for unzipping.

- Package `utility.crypt`
    - Introduced a new package that replaces the old `CryptUtil` class in `utility.lang`.
      that has a more secure API and adds many new features:
        - certificate creation (depends on BouncyCastle being present)
        - key generation and handling
        - key store handling
        - asymmetric encryption
        - message signing
        - ECIES support depends on BouncyCastle being present

- Package `utility.options`
    - The package has been completely refactored to be more consistent and allow for finer control.
      It is now for example easier to create options that have enum or record generic type.
      The different `Option` implementing classes have been replaced by a single `Option<T>` generic class.
    - `ArgumentsParser.help()` output was changed to be more informative and use system line ends as its intended use is
      to display a help message in the system terminal.
    - Use `Option.isEquivalent()` instead of `equals()` when checking for specific options.

- Package `utility.text`
    - `TextUtil`
        - Added `TextUtil.toCharArray()|charsToBytes()|bytesToChars()`.
        - Added `removeLeading|Trailing|LeadingAndTrailing()` to efficently strip elements from the start or end of a list.
        - Removed the MD5-methods. MD5 can still be used by passing "MD5" as algorithm name. Reason: MD5 is considered
          cryptographically weak and insecure, and the API should not make using an unsecure algorithm easier to use than
          a secure one. Which algorithms are considered safe is always subject to ongoing research, so be neutral about
          algorithms.
    - `RichText`
        - Fix some RichText.split() issues; the method should now always produce results consistent with String.split()

- Other changes
    - Run tasks have been added for the sample applications.
    - Removed `LogBuffer.size()` - the method could not be used meaningfully in a multithreaded environment.
    - Removed `StreamGathererUtil.filterAndMap()` and related methods - these did offer significant value over chaining
      `filter()` and `map()`.
    - Fix a race condition that sometimes would lead to a failure of the `IoUtil.testRedirectStandardStreams()`
      tests when a test on another thread used standard I/O at the same time (which it really should not).

### 19.2.1

- fix: incorrect implementation of FxUtil.convert(Affine)
- fix: ClosePath not implemented by FxUtil.convert(Path2f)
- fix: LogBuffer thread-safety issues and externalization
- PathBuilder2f: add overloads for passing float values x, y instead of Vector2f
- run FX tests in forked mode to avoid exceptions due to starting and stopping the Platform multiple times in the same JVM
- increase unit test coverage

### 19.2.0

- the Gradle build was changed to use the toolchain and JavaFX plugins again. This facilitates building the library
  on all platforms except Windows ARM. Building on Windows ARM is not supported. This does not affect using the library
  on that platform.
- fix: SwingGraphics.drawImage() draws at wrong position
- fix: SwingGraphics.clip(Rectangle2f) was missing a corner
- fix: the comparator returned by IoUtil.lexicalPathComparator() considered null paths to be greater than non-null paths
- improve performance of TeeOutputStream
- updates and fixes to the ProgressView/ProgressTracker and related classes
- the rendered images created during rendering tests can be downloaded from GitHub to check if the rendering works
  correctly; this is necessary because even on the same OS there may be differences in rendering depending on the
  installed fonts or rendering pipeline (software rendering didn't completely solve this)
- increase unit test coverage

### 19.1.1

- fix: ClassCastException in ImmutableSortedMap.containsKey()
- fix: wrong results for subSet(), headSet(), tailSet() obtained from reversed instances of ImmutableListBackedSortedSet
- fix: TextUtil.contentEquals() always returns false for non-empty strings
- fix: TextUtil.quoteIfNeeded() quoting the empty string
- increased unit test coverage

### 19.1.0

- POSSIBLY BREAKING: OptionException constructors all take the causing Option as first Argument and
  OptionException is derived from the new class ArgumentsException. In cases where the number of free
  arguments (i.e., arguments that do not belong to any option) does not match the definition of the
  ArgumentsParser, an ArgumentsException instead of an OptionException is thrown.
- Added flags to configure CsvReader, see the unit test for examples.
- fix: always return an array of the same type as the argument in ImmutableListBackedSortedSet.toArray(T[])
- fix: NPE in TextAttributes.hashCode() when an attribute value is null
- fix some minor issues and Qodana warnings
- fix: possible inconsistent hash values for RichText
- fix: possible XXE in XmlUtil.prettyPrint()
- fix: possible exponential runtime for evaluating regex in Jdbc support classes
- FontDef is not Cloneable anymore, FontDef.copy() was introduced instead
- added coverage and Sonarcloud scanning in addition to Qodana to CI
- added more unit tests, including some tests for swing classes
- small fixes and improvements
- code cleanup
- updated Gradle wrapper, plugins, dependencies

### 19.0.0

- BREAKING: This version has some breaking changes to the Font classes:
    - The font classes now have a `families` Attribute of type `List<String>` instead of
      a single `family` attribute of type `String`. This was necessary to support alternative
      font families (like in CSS).
    - new method Font.getType() returns either `FontType.MONOSPACED` or `FontType.Proportional`.
    - `Style.FONT_TYPE` was replaced by `Style.FONT_CLASS` and `Style.FONT_FAMILY`
    - added assertions to check for valid attribute types
    - Changes to the FontUtil implementations; if a JavaFX or AWT font is requested, the different
      families are tested for availability on the system and the first available one is used to
      instantiate the platform font. You can add one of `"serif"`, `"sans-serif"`, and `"monospace"`
      at the end of the family list (these are always available) to make sure a matching fallback
      font is selected.
    - The HtmlConverter will use `<code>` tags if the font family is set to `monospace`, i.e, if
      `monospace` is the first family listed in the font's list of font families and CSS is not
      used (pass the HtmlConversionOption `useCss(false)` when creating the converter). Otherwise,
      a `<span>` is used to set the font.
- updated plugins and dependencies
- some minor fixes and improvements

### 18.6.0

This version is all about reducing memory consumption. The new classes are used internally by RichText and
RichTextBuilder but can be universally used. Large RichText instances (several million characters, each having
different attributes), memory usage went down by 50% without noticeable impact on runtime performance.

- LangUtil: added two new methods, LangUtil.asUnmodifiableSortedListSet() and LangUtil.asUnmodifiableList(),
  and the implementing classes that offer memory efficient Set and Map implementations
- LangUtil.isOfKnownImmutableType()
- TextAttributes storage has been changed from a TreeMap to a custom SortedSet implementation (s.a.) backed by
  a sorted array, greatly reducing memory consumption (in tests up to 80%). This change is transparent.
- FxUtil.runOnNextFrame()
- ImmutableSortedListBackedSet as a memory efficient immutable SortedSet implementation
- ImmutableSortedMap as a memory efficient Map implementation for immutable maps
- CompactableSortedMap to provide a mutable map that can be compacted to an ImmutableSortedMap to reduce memory
  consumption and will be restored to a standard Map when mutated
- RichTextBuilder now internally uses CompactableSortedMap to reduce memory consumption when large RichText instances
  are created.

### 18.5.1

- fix PinBoard.scroll() units when scale != 1
- PinBoard.getViewPortInBoardCoordinates()
- PinBoard.getPositionInBoard()

### 18.5.0

- BREAKING: PinBoard interpretation of the additional parameters to some of the scrolling methods
  was changed from a viewport relative offset to an absolute offset in pixel
- PinBoard: introduce a display scale to zoom the pinboard contents; several fixes to the PinBoard class
- PinBoard: optimized rendering to remove flickering when changing scale
- SliderWithButtons: implements InputControl; support for setting ticks
- InputPaneBuilder.slider()
- added some conversion methods to better support StringProperty and DoubleProperty

### 18.4.1

- add RichText.runStream()
- LangUtil: add constants for empty arrays of primitive types
- code cleanup and performance improvements
- removed the unused markerLevelMap from LoggerSlf4j

### 18.4.0

- This version brings many changes for image handling.

  BREAKING CHANGES
  - The pixel format has been changed from INT_ARGB to INT_ARGB_PRE. This was
    necessary to be able to share the image data between JavaFX and AWT implementations.
  - AwtImage.bufferedImage() was removed as AwtImage is now derived from BufferedImae.
    Pass the AwtImage instance directly whenever a BufferedImage is needed.

  DESCRIPTION OF THE CHANGES

  A new MutableImage interface has been introduced. The getBuffer() method returns a
  low-level ImageBuffer instance that writes directly through to the pixel data.

  To create a MutableImage, use ImageUtil.createBufferedImage(). The returned instance
  is a subclass of java.awt.BufferedImage in both the AWT and JavaFX implementations.
  This makes it possible to use libraries that work directly on java.awt.BufferedImage
  in both the JavaFX and AWT implementations.

  FxImage has been changed to an interface. FxImageUtil.create() will now return an
  instance of FxStandardImage whereas FxImageUtil will return an FxImage instance that
  can be directly passed as a BufferedImage to code that works on BufferedImage instances.
  Any changes made to the image data will write directly through to the JavaFX image.

### 18.3.1

- code cleanups and performance improvements

### 18.3.0

- POSSIBLY BREAKING: HtmlTag.headerChange() now returns int instead of OptionalInt and the static factory methods have also
  been changed accordingly. This should not be a problem for most since while part of the public API, the methods
  should in general not be used directly, but from the HtmlConverter class.
- Fixed the Qodana scan during CI build which broke due to Java 24 code being included in the multi-release JAR.
- TextUtil.lexicographicalComparator()
- IoUtil.lexicalPathComparator()
- StreamGatherUtil.mapAndFilter()
- add unit tests for Java 24 code
- some code cleanup and Javadoc additions

### 18.2.0

- added StreamGatherUtil (only available in Java 24+)
- updated ikonli to 12.4.0
- DataUtil.isSorted()
- RichText.isBlank()

  To derive a font from a base font, use FontUtil as well.

  The Font class has been enhanced with methods to retrieve metric data like ascent, descent, and space width

  Memory footprint should be slightly reduced and performance increased for applications that dynamically allocate
  Font instances.

### 14

**NOTE:** starting with this release, for development builds of this library (i.e., builds that are neither
release nor release candidate builds), return values of all methods returning a @NullMarked or @NonNull
object (or derived) type are checked and will unconditionally throw an AssertionFailedError if the return
value is found to be inconsistent.

Any AssertionError you encounter (with a message "invalid return value") means that you have found a bug
in the library and are asked to open an issue against the library.

Release candidates and final releases will not contain any return value check.

Changes:
- org.jspecify annotations are used in the code base; all modules annotated with `@NullMarked`.
  That you may not pass `null` in any method or constructor parameter that is not explicitly
  annotated as `@Nullable`.
- module definitions have been reviewed.
- change type parameter for IoUtil.closeAll() to `? extends AutoCloseable`
- complete Javadoc
- code cleanup and bug fixes
- XmlUtil.defaultInstance() and jaxpInstance() both return new instances for every invocation
  because the returned instances are not thread safe

### 13.1.2

- IoUtil.closeAll()
- code cleanup
- prevent serialization of logging related classes for security reasons
- javadoc

### 13.1.1

- FIX: do not throw an exception when temp directory permissions cannot be set, log a warning message instead. The
  reason is that especially the Files.setWriteable() does not seem to always return correct results, even when the  
  directory does have the requested permissions.

### 13.1

- BREAKING: in the fx module, the methods Validator.matches() and Validator.notEmpty() have been renamed to setRegex()
  and disallowEmpty() to better express the fact that the content is not checked immediately but instead a rule is added
  that is validated at validation time
- IMPORTANT: resolved ambiguity of LangUtil.ConsumerThrows.andThen() overloads by renaming the version taking an 
  argument of ConsumerThrows to andThenTry(); this might require a source change but code compiled using the previous
  version should still work in the same way
- IoUtil: added methods createSecureTempDirectory(), createSecureTempDirectoryAndDeleteOnExit(), deleteRecursiveOnExit()
- small improvements and code cleanup

### 13.0.2

- add overload of DataUtil.diff() that takes a map factory

### 13.0.1

- TextUtil.toString(Object obj, String valueIfNull)
- use HexFormat for converting Color instances to hex format
- add Text Filter to FxLogPane

- StreamUtil.concat() did not close streams
- SwingImageUtil, SwingFontUtil have been renamed to AwtImageUtil, AwtFontUtil as they are usable also in non-Swing 
  applications
- Color methods have been renamed to reduce ambiguity
- SwingUtil.getDisplayScale() to retrieve the actual scaling factor for the display (taking into account UHD and retina displays)
- AffineTransformation2f.combine()
- return value of getTextDimension() changed to Rectangle2f (this gives access to the baseline value)
- Rectangle2f.getXCenter(), getYCenter(), min(), max(), center(), dimension(), withCenter()
- Dimension2f.scaled()
- Font.scaled()
- TextUtil.isBlank(CharSequence)
- toolkit agnostic Graphics interface and implementations for Swing and JavaFX
- code cleanups and reorganizations

  follows:
    * if value is {@code null}, {@code null} is returned;
    * if the target class is assignment compatible, a simple cast is performed;
    * if the target class is `String`, `Object.toString()` is used;
    * if the target class is an integer type and the value is of type double, a conversion without loss of precision is
      tried;
    * if the target class provides a method `public static T valueOf(T)` and `value instanceof U`, that method is
      invoked;
    * if `useConstructor` is `true` and the target class provides a constructor taking a single argument of value's
      type, that constructor is used;
    * otherwise an exception is thrown.

  create a tree of files and subdirectories of a directory
- moved the `Pair` and `Color` classes to the `com.dua3.utility.data` package
- renamed `Options` to `OptionValues`

### Version 3.1.4

- REMOVED: `Font.getAwtFont()` and `Font.getTextWidth()`; these introduced a dependency on java.desktop and can be
  easily replaced where needed.
- The utility.db library now include methods to dynamically load JDBC drivers. This allows to use jlink on applications
  that use non-modular JDBC-drivers.

    - java.xml
    - java.desktop
    - java.sql
